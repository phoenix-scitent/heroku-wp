AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION

INTERNATIONAL AHA ONLINE PORTAL PRIVACY NOTICE

American Heart Association and its affiliates (collectively “AHA”) respect your privacy and protect your personal data. This Privacy Notice applies only if you are located in the European Economic Area [or another country outside the United States of America] and to the online collection of personal data when you purchase or activate a Key to take a course through the website www.OnlineAHA.org. The word “Key” refers to an alphanumeric code which is required in order to register for and access an online course through www.OnlineAHA.org. For other questions pertaining to our other data processing and related privacy practice, please consult our heart.org Privacy Policy here.

This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal data we collect, how we use the data, and with whom we share it. This Privacy Notice also describes the measures we take to protect your personal data, how to exercise your rights and how to contact us.

1. Personal Data We Collect and How We Use It

The personal data we process is either (1) provided directly by you on a voluntary basis to the AHA or to the entity that purchased the Key on your behalf or (2) collected automatically. By personal data we mean “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” such as name, address, e-mail, unique identifier, etc. Below are the ways you may provide personal data and the types of personal data you may submit. We also tell you how we may use the personal data.

 

1.1. Personal Data You Provide To Us on a Voluntary Basis

 

You may choose to provide personal data. If you choose not to provide us with your personal data, you may not be able to access some of our services and may be unable to take an AHA course online or obtain a course completion card. The personal data you provide us on a voluntary basis is either entered directly by you into the system or by the third party from whom you purchased the Key or that purchased the Key on your behalf.

Enrollment in one of our online courses: When enrolling in one of our online courses and to receive a course completion card, you will be asked to provide the AHA with your name, contact details, professional category and specialty, and course in which you are enrolling. This personal data is processed for managing our training courses and to provide you with the appropriate training material and course completion certificate.

Obtaining Continuing Education Credits: In order to obtain continuing education credits, should such credits be available to your profession, you will be asked to voluntarily provide us with your professional category (such as RN, EMT, physician) and may be required to provide your license number or national certifying organizations registration number. This information is required by the state licensing boards and national certification organizations in order for us to generate the appropriate continuing education certificate for your use in obtaining continuing education credits for the course you complete through OnlineAHA.org. Should you decide not to provide this information, then you will not be able to obtain continuing education credits for the course that you complete.

Marketing: You may sign up to receive errata’s (corrections or updates of your course book), electronic newsletters and promotional e-mails from AHA. We will not send you any of these communications before obtaining your prior opt-in consent. To sign up, we ask you to choose the communications which you would like to receive and ask you for personal data such as your e-mail address. We only use your e-mail address to send you communications regarding our services which you have requested such as reminders for course renewals, errata’s, and additional course offerings. You may change your election and opt out of receiving these communications at any time by using one of the options described under your Rights and Choices [add link]

Contact us - Information and Support Request: If you wish to obtain information or support from AHA, you may contact us through various communication means. The specific personal data you must submit will depend on the information or support requested. AHA will only use your data to contact you and to provide the information or support you requested.

 

1.2. Personal Data We Collect Automatically

 

Like many companies, AHA uses log files to enhance your visit to our Site and to better understand how our Site is used. Log files are web server files that are automatically created when a user visits a site. AHA does not use persistent cookies on www.onlineaha.org.

 

2. Personal Data We Share

 

We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal data about you, except as described in this Privacy Notice. Otherwise we will do so only with your explicit consent.

 

We may share your personal data with our affiliates, Training Entities, LMS Providers, and accreditation organizations for the specific purposes described in this privacy notice. The word Training Entities means organizations, individuals, instructors, training centers or training centers that utilize AHA courses as part of their training activities or reseller or distributors of Keys. Your personal data would only be shared with the Training Entity through which you obtained your Key or completed the lab component of any course for the purpose of administering the course and verifying course completion. LMS Providers means a third party that operates a learning management system through which it has purchased and administers Keys. We may share your personal data with the LMS Provider through which you obtained your Key for purposes of course administration and verification of course completion. We may also share your personal data with service providers we have retained to perform various services on our behalf. These service providers are contractually required to act only on our instructions and to maintain an appropriate level of data protection and data security. Service providers are not authorized by us to use the data for their own purposes or to disclose the data to third parties except if necessary to perform services or functions for AHA or to comply with legal requirements. For example, service providers are not authorized by AHA to use the personal data for their own marketing purposes.

 

We may disclose data about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or pursuant to a Court order, or (ii) in response to a legitimate request from law enforcement authorities. We also reserve the right to transfer any data we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee uses personal data you have provided through this Site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you do not want the transferee to further process your personal data in such case, you should contact the transferee.

 

3. Your Rights and Choices

 

You have the right to receive information about the personal data stored about you and to access, rectify, block or delete your personal data by logging onto OnlineAHA.org and making these changes to your account or using the contact information provided below in the “How to Contact Us” section here. Following any request, we will accommodate your inquiry as required by applicable law. If the personal data collected is incorrect, inaccurate or outdated, we will correct it within a reasonable period of time following your request for correction.

 

You can, at any time, and free of charge, choose not to receive newsletters and promotional e-mails from us by editing your registration to opt out of marketing, by clicking on the unsubscribe link included in our e-mails, or by contacting us via “How to Contact Us” Section. You also have the right to object to the processing of personal data by AHA, at any time on compelling legitimate grounds, except when otherwise provided by applicable law. You understand that if you object to the processing of personal data by AHA, you may not be able to access an online course at OnlineAHA.org or receive a course completion card, verification of course completion, or obtain continuing education credits.

 

If the personal data is processed with your consent, you may revoke this consent at any time by logging onto OnlineAHA.org and revoking your consent or by using the contact information provided below in the “How to Contact Us” section here. If you decide to revoke your consent, we will block or delete your personal data and any reference to you will be deleted with effect to the future.

 

4. Data Transfers

 

AHA mainly collects, processes and uses your personal data within the United States of America (the "U.S."). However, as a global company, we may from time to time transfer your personal data to countries which do not provide for an adequate level of data protection for the purposes of administration of OnlineAHA.org, verifying continuing education credits, and for administrative purposes by the Training Center or LMS Provider.

 

When transferring your personal data outside of the European Union or if we use third party service providers located outside of the European Union, we take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws, in particular the legal requirements on adequate protection for data transfers to countries outside of the European Union. In particular, you understand and agree that your personal data will be sent to the U.S. for administration of OnlineAHA.org or to other countries which do not provide for an adequate level of data protection. If you no longer wish to consent to the transfer of your personal data as described in this paragraph, please log on to OnlineAHA.org and revoke your consent or contact us as explained in the "How to Contact Us" section of this Privacy Notice.

 

5. Records Retention

 

AHA only retains personal data for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which they were collected, unless otherwise provided by law. When the personal data is no longer necessary to meet the purposes for which it was collected, it is deleted, blocked or anonymized.

 

6. Security

 

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and all other unlawful forms of processing of the personal data in our possession.

 

In particular, we protect personal data with appropriate security measures where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network. When you provide personal data online, we use the industry standard for encryption on the Internet – Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology – to help protect the data that you provide. This Internet encryption standard scrambles data as it travels from your computer to our server. You will know that you are in a secure area of our website when a lock icon appears on your screen that the “http” prefix of our URL address changes to "https." The "s" means "secure."

 

7. Updates to This Privacy Notice

 

We may change or update portions of this Privacy Notice at any time and without prior notice to you. Please check from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the Privacy Notice. In case of substantial changes to the Privacy Notice, we will, however, post a notice on the homepage and the changes will only be effective 30 days after their posting.
